# Jericho's Library (by DJSng)
### A general resources page of various topics.
Jericho's Library is the new, permanent home of my resources page, which was present on my site (and prior, on my SpaceHey) for approximately two years. I have decided to move it under a GitHub organization like the rest of my Toolkit related projects, where it can happily stay.  

This page is mostly inspired by FMHY, with a bit of redundant resources removed every once and a while, or an occasional site that I like, that nobody's ever talked about.  

**This page is structured differently than other DJSng's Toolkit resources**, where this README holds all of the resources with no changes or extra click.  

This page does not include anything listed on DJSng's Toolkit, as that's not its purpose. You should still read [DJSng's Toolkit's library of resources](https://github.com/djsng-toolkit/index) if something interests you.

# Other resource pages
Pages that are specifically designed just to provide resources.  
Includes really good resource pages by Neocities users, as well as general resources.

| Name | Author | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [🏆 FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH](https://fmhy.net/) | Estd & FMHY Community | Amazing general resources page. Has free and paid stuff, great for those who might be new to sailing and/or just need alternative software for popular solutions. |
| [Ivyswell's Tavern - Resources](https://ivyswell-tavern.neocities.org/resources) | [Kie](https://ivyswell-tavern.neocities.org) | Run by a friend on SpaceHey. Very general resources page, with some stuff for scene kids. |

# Technology - Software
## Windows feature alternatives
Software that's mainly used to replace Windows functionalities by optimizing them, doing them differently, etc.  
Some of these may not be able to reverted.

| Name | Author | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [🏆 Directory Opus](https://www.gpsoft.com.au/) | GP Software | Amazing, customizable explorer alternative for Windows File Explorer, with customizable themes, better program support and generally just better performance. **Paid.** |
| [🏆 Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/) | voidtools | Also called "Voidtools Everything" to avoid confusion. Lightweight alternative to Windows search that uses NTFS Indexing (like Windows) and database caching to keep things fresh. Searches are instant, unlike Windows. |
| [Explorer++](https://explorerplusplus.com/) | David Erceg | Lightweight, **free to use** alternative for Windows File Explorer. May be buggy. Use the nightly builds for more features, stable was last updated in Janurary 2024. |

## Remote Control
> [!WARNING]  
> ***NEVER*** install a remote control software if instructed by another user, especially if it's to "clean" your computer of viruses. The caller on the other end will just steal and delete all of your files. 
> 
> You should only need a software of this kind if you want to access one of your devices from another device, or you need to perform tech tasks over the internet that need some help from a nerd.

Software that allows you to access a device from another device.

| Name | Author | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [✨ Aspia](https://aspia.org/) | Dmitry Chapyshev | Really cool alternative for TeamViewer. Mac OS and Linux have limited support and are missing features that Windows user have (Mac and Linux users can only connect, Windows users can also host). Requires some technical knowledge. You may need to port forward to connect outside of LAN (i.e: connections outside your house). |
| [RustDesk](https://rustdesk.com/) | RustDesk community | Good open source alternative for TeamViewer. UI might be a little chopped in places and I've had issues before (connection issues for CA -> US connections, file transfer being a little dog), but it's better than paying to use it and being disconnected everytime you connect with Phone. |

# Technology - Internet
## Web Browsing
### Browsers
Software that lets you browse the web.

| Name | Author | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [🏆 Firefox](https://www.firefox.com) | Mozilla | Great default browser if you want effective adblocking, no bullshit and browser themes that do more than change the colors. Good as a "de-facto" if you need more resources.
| [⭐ Floorp](https://floorp.app) | Ablaze | Amazing Firefox fork with some more customization options than Firefox and some other features. Works with Mozilla Sync. Floorp 12 may be hostile to some themes, especially FirefoxGX. If you plan to use themes and want to be safe, either downgrade to Floorp 11 (until it goes out of support) or move to base Firefox instead. |
| [✨ Supermium](https://github.com/win32ss/supermium) | win32ss | A very cool fork of Google's "Chromium" browser engine, which is basically just open source Google Chrome with some very minor stuff missing. Has support for below Windows 10, and some Manifest V2 Extension support. **Not a replacement for Firefox**, do not use if you are vulnerable to ads, the adblocking is not as effective as Firefox. |
| [Brave](https://brave.com/) | Brave Team | An alright Chromium option with an adblocker that has the goal of reaching uBlock Origins level of good, even after Manifest V3's death. I have beef with their AI and Crypto inclusions. Also, they've been known to Cryptojack and such, use at your own risk. |
| [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/) | Vivaldi Team | Very cool Chromium option that's run by the former head of Opera. **Their adblocker sucks**, do not use it. |
| [Zen Browser](https://zen-browser.app/) | Zen Team | Cool fork of Firefox with an alternative take on the UI. Also has a "mods" store which has some CSS snippets that might be of help. You might not want to use themes with this. |

### Firefox Themes
> [!IMPORTANT]
> All themes here require manual install that may be confusing to some users.

Firefox themes, mostly built on CSS.

| Name | Author | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [✨ Firefox GX](https://github.com/Godiesc/firefox-gx) | Godiesc | Very cool Opera GX theme for users coming to Firefox. Has a lot of customization for a lot of edge cases. |

### Extensions
> [!WARNING]
> This section is mainly tailored to Firefox user.

Extensions you can add to your browser to do more.

| Name | Author | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [🏆 uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) | Raymond Hill | General ad & content blocker, best on the market. **Does not properly block content on Chromium**, due to blocking content before the page loads not being possible. Some ads might slip through. Also, **their lite version is very limited** and may perform worse. |

### Tools for the Web
Tools on the web, for the web.

| Name | Author | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [GitHub Wiki TOC Generator](https://ecotrust-canada.github.io/markdown-toc/) | John Schlinkert | A generator for making Table of Contents in Markdown, great for GitHub Wiki and READMEs. Used on this page! Linked is an outdated fork hosted by another user. |

### Other Cool Websites
Cool websites that don't fit any other category.

| Name | Author | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [WinAmp Skin Museum](https://skins.webamp.org/) | Jordan Eldredge | Huge archive of WinAmp skins that's usable in your web browser thanks to Webamp. |

## Music
### Downloading
Tools to download music.  
Be responsible.

| Name | Author | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [⭐ Nicotine+](https://nicotine-plus.org/) | Nicotine+ Team | Really good Soulseek client. |

### Playing - Locally
Tools to play music from local files. Great if you download your music.

| Name | Author | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [🏆 foobar2000](https://www.foobar2000.org/) | Peter Pawlowski | Amazing local player with a lot of customization.
| [AIMP](https://www.aimp.ru/) | Artem Izmaylov | Very cool music player that I used to use a lot. **The main page may be in Russian** because the author is Russian. Most of the site should be in English. | 
| [MusicBee](https://www.getmusicbee.com/) | 	Steven Mayall | MusicBee is a pretty cool alternative player. It has built-in last.fm support. |
| [WACUP](https://getwacup.com/) | DrO | 

### Playing - Websites
Websites where you can play and stream music without downloading a single thing.

# Gaming - General
General gaming resources and guides that can apply to a variety of games.

## Resources & Guides
Guides and resources for a big collection of games... Duh.

| Name | Author | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [✨ PCGamingWiki](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Home) | PCGamingWiki Community | Great resource for older video games. Some of its pages (like Minecraft) might be a little tacky if they have active modding communities that have resources best found elsewhere. |

## Play on the Web
Games you can play on the web!

| Name | Author | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Pac Man](https://masonicgit.github.io/pacman/) | Masonicgit | An online version of Pac Man with extra features. |

## Clones
Clones of games.

| Name | Author | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Luanti](https://www.luanti.org/) | Luanti Team | Formerly known as Minetest. Minecraft clone and fangame. |

## Flash
Adobe Flash resources.

| Name | Author | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [🏆 Flashpoint Archive](https://flashpointarchive.org/) | Flashpoint Team | Free program that lets you play a bunch of archived games, mostly Flash but also some other game engines. Amazing project. |
| [Ninia Kiwi Archive](https://ninjakiwi.com/archive) | Ninja Kiwi | Has a bunch of old free gmaes fron Ninja Kiwi's archive. |

## More Games
Even more games you can try.


# Gaming - Minecraft
Content for Minecraft.

## Launchers
> [!NOTE]
> This page is a mirror of Toolkit's page, with only stuff I would personally recommend.

Tools that let you play the game, with bonuses!

| Name | Author | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [🏆 Prism Launcher](https://github.com/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher) | Prism Launcher Community | Really awesome Minecraft launcher for modders who need something that the Launcher will handle everything for, while still being light! |
| [⭐ BetaCraft](https://betacraft.uk/) | Betacraft Team | Retro launcher for older versions of Minecraft. Mainly only plays game versions before 1.6. Also makes skins work and such! |
| [⭐ Modrinth App](https://modrinth.com/app) | Modrinth | I've not used it myself, but I've heard from many people that Modrinth's own launcher (called Modrinth App) is considered an amazing option for beginners. |
| [✨ ATLauncher](https://atlauncher.com) | RyanTheAlmighty | ATLauncher is a cool launcher I'd consider a sidegrade to Prism, it trades out some of the flash and charm of Prism like it's MultiMC-like UI and it's resource pack management for server creation and management, as well as other takes on what Prism does. It's a little different than Prism and is sponsored, which some might not like. |
| [✨ Quantum Launcher](https://github.com/Mrmayman/quantumlauncher) | Mrmayman | Alternative launcher for Minecraft that's said to be very lightweight. Only a year old. |
| [Bedrock Launcher](https://bedrocklauncher.github.io/) | Carjem | Alternative launcher for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. Lets you download any version from any point. **This is the only Bedrock entry.** |
| [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/) | MultiMC team | Originally a GOAT of the Minecraft launcher space, but Prism outdoes MultIMC nowadays as Prism manages more instance stuff that MultiMC makes you do manually. |
| [Prism Launcher (ely.by fork)](https://github.com/ElyPrismLauncher/ElyPrismLauncher) | Octol1ttle | Fork of Prism for support for the ely.by Minecraft custom skin system. Mainly for users who use that service. |

## Lists
Lists of mods and tools.  
Also check out [Tookit](https://github.com/DJSng-Toolkit/Toolkit/blob/main/mc/README.md)!

| Name | Author | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [⭐ MC-Optimization-Guide](https://github.com/Radk6/MC-Optimization-Guide) | Radk6 | A more minimalist take on TheUsefulLists. Where Toolkit is more "maximalist" and might be a bit much, this guide is nice and minimal. |
| [⭐ UsefulMods](https://github.com/TheUsefulLists/UsefulMods) | TheUsefulLists | The original inspiration for this list! They focus on actually clumping together mods rather than being selective about mods like I'm aiming for, so they might also have a few extra mods I miss. |
| [Legacy Fabric Mod Compatibility List](legacyfabric.net/mods.html)  | Legacy Fabric | General list for mod compatibility for Legacy Fabric supported versions. |
| [List of "Essential" 1.7.10 Mods](https://gist.github.com/makamys/7cb74cd71d93a4332d2891db2624e17c) | Makamys | Good list that goes more in depth about 1.7 options, for retro modders. |

## Software
Software for Minecraft that isn't launchers.

| Name | Author | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [MCreate](https://mcreator.net/) | MCreator Team | Very basic mod creator. Don't expect anything fancy. |
| [NBT Studio](https://github.com/tryashtar/nbt-studio/) | Tryashtar | An updated fork of NBTExplorer. Lets you look through Minecraft level data, playerdata, as well as anything NBT related. |

## Websites
Websites for Minecraft resources and such.

| Name | Author | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [🏆 NameMC](https://namemc.com/) | NameMC Team | Website for viewing servers, skins, and usernames. |
| [🏆 Omniarchive](https://omniarchive.uk/) | Omniarchive team | Amazing version archive of all of Minecraft's obscure versions. Mainly for older versions, but they have newer stuff too. |
| [⭐ VanillaTweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/) | VanillaTweaks team | A good Minecraft resource for texture/resource and datapacks for almost any version of Minecraft that mainly do tweaks for Vanilla use. I always forget to use it, but I've had a lot of fun with it, and some people say their implementation of food hunger regen counts are better than AppleSkin. |
| [Aikar's Flags](https://aikar.co/2018/07/02/tuning-the-jvm-g1gc-garbage-collector-flags-for-minecraft/) | Aikar | Alternative Java JVM flags for Minecraft. Might benefit some users. Be careful. |
| [Ely.by](https://ely.by) | Ely.by team | Custom skin system. Has been used by TLauncher Legacy players in the past to get skins on cracked. |
| [Essential Alternatives](https://notessential.blurry.gay/) | devin | Good list of alternatives for Essential. If you need Essential as a dependancy, use Not So Essential mod. |
| [Minecraft Color Codes](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/minecraft-color-codes/) | htmlcolorcodes.com | Color codes for MOTDs. Does not include the icon you need for Chat, Signs and/or Resource Packs. |
| [PCGamingWiki's page on Minecraft](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Minecraft:_Java_Edition) | PCGamingWiki Community | General information. Not as effective as mod lists, so maybe don't lean on its advice too hard. |
| [ShaderLABS](https://shaderlabs.org/wiki/Main_Page) | ??? | Resources for Shaders, such as what's most updated and some FAQs. |

# General guides
Tutorials and walkthroughs on how to do cool things.

| Name | Author | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Connecting NeoCities to your Discord Profile](https://gist.github.com/hf02/1570e009bd337bc09db6f3e3c29938ca) | hf02 | N/A |
| [Prism4Free](https://rentry.co/prism4free) | Pancakes, DomHeadroom, LTSC recommender, InternetNinja, TheRedSpecial | Guide for cracking Prism Launcher, so you can play offline. Does not require a fork at all. Good if you don't want to use a fork. |

# Avoid
Software you should avoid for different reasons, such as possibly containing malware, generally being poor software, being run by shit companies, etc.  
Also check in with [FMHY](https://fmhy.net/unsafesites), which covers more software I haven't included.

## Software - Remote Control
| Name | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| [TeamViewer](https://www.teamviewer.com/en-ca/) | Where to start? They can randomly disconnect you if they think you're not using it for personal use, they have begun to integrate AI, you can no longer file transfer for free, and their mobile support having gone to shit recently. Use an alternative instead. |

## Software - Music
| Name | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| [Winamp](https://winamp.com/) | Just use WACUP, which is from an OFFICIAL developer of WinAmp who is still around. The company that current owns Winamp have tried to integrate NFTs in Winamp, and modern Winamp is mostly targetted for mobile. Their legacy builds for Winamp (5.x) are terrible and have been known to be buggy. |

## Software - Games
| Name | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| [TLauncher](https://tlauncher.org/) | Not to be confused with [TLauncher Legacy](https://archive.org/details/tl-legacy-installer-legacy_20240328). Shitty, Russian based Minecraft launcher that has been known several times to contain malware. |
