# Jericho's Library (by DJSng)
### A general resources page of various topics.
<!-- contributors please use https://ecotrust-canada.github.io/markdown-to to generate the TOC with every change -->
Jericho's Library is the new, permanent home of my resources page, which was present on my site (and prior, on my SpaceHey) for approximately two years. I have decided to move it under a GitHub organization like the rest of my Toolkit related projects, where it can happily stay.  

This page is mostly inspired by FMHY, with a bit of redundant resources removed every once and a while, or an occasional site that I like, that nobody's ever talked about.  

**This page is structured differently than other DJSng's Toolkit resources**, where this README holds all of the resources with no changes or extra click.  
Please note that this page is still under construction. I mostly operate this entire thing alone. If you want to read something more complete, please read [the old guide](oldguide.md) that was up long before this draft.

This page does not include anything listed on DJSng's Toolkit, as that's not its purpose. You should still read [DJSng's Toolkit's library of resources](https://github.com/djsng-toolkit/index) if something interests you.

## Old version of this page


## Other resource directories

| Name | Author | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH](https://fmhy.net/) | Estd & FMHY Community | Amazing general resources page. Has free and paid stuff, great for those who might be new to sailing and/or just need alternative software for popular solutions. |
| [Ivyswell's Tavern - Resources](https://ivyswell-tavern.neocities.org/resources) | [Kie](https://ivyswell-tavern.neocities.org) | Run by a friend on SpaceHey. Very general resources page, with some stuff for scene kids. |

# Gaming - General
| Name | Author | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [PCGamingWiki](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Home) | PCGamingWiki Community | Great resource for older video games. Some of its pages (like Minecraft) might be a little tacky if they have active modding communities that have resources best found elsewhere. |

## Lists
| Name | Author | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Legacy Fabric Mod Compatibility List](legacyfabric.net/mods.html)  | Legacy Fabric | General list for mod compatibility for Legacy Fabric supported versions. |
| [List of "Essential" 1.7.10 Mods](https://gist.github.com/makamys/7cb74cd71d93a4332d2891db2624e17c) | Makamys | Good list that goes more in depth about 1.7 options, for retro modders. |
| [MC-Optimization-Guide](https://github.com/Radk6/MC-Optimization-Guide) | Radk6 | A more minimalist take on TheUsefulLists. Where Toolkit is more "maximalist" and might be a bit much, this guide is nice and minimal.
| [UsefulMods](https://github.com/TheUsefulLists/UsefulMods) |TheUsefulLists | The original inspiration for this list! They focus on actually clumping together mods rather than being selective about mods like I'm aiming for, so they might also have a few extra mods I miss. |

## Websites
| Name | Author | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [VanillaTweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/) | VanillaTweaks team | A good Minecraft resource for texture/resource and datapacks for almost any version of Minecraft that mainly do tweaks for Vanilla use. I always forget to use it, but I've had a lot of fun with it, and some people say their implementation of food hunger regen counts are better than AppleSkin. |

## Launchers
(this mirrors Toolkit, but in a slimmed form)
| Name | Author | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [ATLauncher](https://atlauncher.com) | RyanTheAlmighty | ATLauncher is a cool launcher I'd consider a sidegrade to Prism, it trades out some of the flash and charm of Prism like it's MultiMC-like UI and it's resource pack management for server creation and management, as well as other takes on what Prism does. It's a little different than Prism and is sponsored, which some might not like. |
| [Prism Launcher](https://github.com/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher) | Prism Launcher Community | Really awesome Minecraft launcher for modders who need something that the Launcher will handle everything for, while still being light! |
