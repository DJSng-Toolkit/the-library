About this page
===============

Hi! I wrote this piace to link to a bunch of resources that I use. I had wanted to link these for a long while, but I always struggled to update it. Hopefully, this should be the last time.  
Everything here, except for ones clearly labeled as "Paid" in brackets, are free to use in some way. If you struggle to find the free download option, feel free to come find me, but just be careful if you don't want to go through that kind of hastle.

And please, for gods sake, use an adblocker. Firefox users can use uBlock Origin out of the box just fine, but users that have anything Chromium based (i.e: Chrome, Opera, Brave) should switch to Firefox if they can. Some browsers may have an adblock that kinda works (Brave, Vivaldi), but using the best adblocker out there (uBlock Origin) will not properly block ads. I've seen some friends use uBO on Opera and still see ads because the adblockercouldn't block the ads by the time the page loaded, which caused confusion and ads to be clickable anyway. Beware!

Recommended Programs
====================

For anybody who's looking for new things to try, I decided to make a list of software and websites I trust and recommend to anybody who's looking for something new. This list isn't very long and I need to add more, but feel free to ask for recommendations and I'll slam some here. I'm not exactly a tech support genius, so if I say to check in with other people and I point you to a support page or something, maybe it's best to ask there.

I promise, I've at least tried these softwares and double checked I wrote the right link!

Web Browsers
------------

  
[Floorp Browser](https://floorp.app/en) - You like Firefox? Used it before? Good, imagine it but faster. I cannot live without Firefox considering adblockers are going to die very fast, I don't completely like Brave and Chrome's extension store has nothing good for sidebar tabs, but Tree Style Tabs has done just as good as a job! Only thing is that Tree Style Tabs is a firefox exclusive, but many of the ROBLOX extensions I like are kind of buggy on Firefox (at least right now, but that'll change soon when RoPro v2.0 comes out), but it's a compromise I'm willing to make for now.  
  

Music
-----

[foobar2000](https://www.foobar2000.org/) - If you were like me, you probably used those sketchy YouTube to MP3 downloaders and Windows Media Player. Foobar2000 is like the adult version of WMP, with way more features I find myself addicted to, as well as it's superior customization. You want something? Somebody's probably added it.  
  
[Nicotine+](https://nicotine-plus.org/) - Wanted to get into the Soulseek scene but didn't know where to start? Or you just hate the default client? Nicotine+ has been recommended by many people, myself included, and it's a great place to start if you're looking to just learn to use Soulseek. You could also go to SoulseekQT for the retro style, but... Nicotine+ just functions better.  
  

Utility
-------

  
[RustDesk](https://rustdesk.com/) - I started to despise TeamViewer when they made changes to how it handled connections. When I was initially looking for replacements and wanted something easy, this is what I found. It has a mobile app, a computer app, works on basically everything TeamViewer does, and while it's a little different, it did the job.  
  
[Aspia](https://aspia.org/) - When I needed something more than RustDesk, and wanted some more control over what I could do, I switched to Aspia. While it's computer only and most of it's features are only on Windows, it has features like using relays and routers to get around NAT issues, a console with address book functionality, the ability to just _watch_ the screen (which Parsec is better for, but it is what it is), better file transferring than RustDesk, customizable stream settings, and a load bunch of other features that perfectly replaced TeamViewer. Plus, it worked out of the box on my LAN setup, so I was able to plug and play with my sibling, even without forwarding a bunch of random ports.  
  
[Voidtools Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/) - Get rid of the old Windows Search, you can settle for more. Voidtools Everything is a replacement for Windows Search that searches the whole drive a little more efficiently by caching what's on your drive, among other things. It made it much easier to find files rather than just click around blindly hoping you find it.  
  
[Directory Opus](https://www.gpsoft.com.au/) (paid) - Windows Explorer is kind of quirky, and that's why I have Directory Opus. It can work with Voidtools Everything for windows search, among other features, like custom colors for explorer windows, folder favorites, and a lot more I can't explain just in one blog post.  
  
[Explorer++](https://explorerplusplus.com/) - If you're too lazy to throw cash for Directory Opus or just can't afford it right now, Explorer++ is a good free alternative. It won't feel remotely the same but may be easier to get into.  
  

Non-Software
============

Some stuff I've used is not strictly computer software, and when I have something to put related to that, it'll be here.

  

Websites
--------

  
[Winamp Skin Museum](https://skins.webamp.org/) - Built off the project Webamp, the Winamp Skin Museum is an interactive Winamp Skin collection in your browser! It has a bunch of obscure and common Winamp skins alike and it's a little something for your Nostalgia toolkit. It really does whip the Llama's ass!
